## Goals
We wanted to create a device that when worn, could act like an instrument. For example, by closing your fist, a certain note is played and opening the fist creates another note -- intensity of muscle strain corresponding to how loud the note is played

## Tools
We used the MyoBand, Wekinator, OSCulator, and Processing to make this happen

## Accomplished
So far, we have accomplished getting the myo band to recognize intensity of muscle strain along with 2 different classes (kind of).

## Challenges
Getting the MyoBand to recognize different classes proved to be very challening, It seems as though the max that you can easily classify is around 2 or 3 different classes. We had enough trouble classifying two (still do not have a working two class model). 

## Demo
We could not get a demo working, as we are taking the weekend to try and train a better working odel.

## Learned
We learned a lot about how to approach problems, and how to examine what different things should be different classes. Going into this, we thought it would be easy to train the MyoBand on each individual finger, and that proved to be difficult, and we had to learn better ways to see what would make good classes.
